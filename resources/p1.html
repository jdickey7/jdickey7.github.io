            The School for Play was built upon ideas of repetition as show with the stairs and foam blocks. 
            The exterior doors allow flexibility to the classrooms as they slide open. 
            The classrooms could expand outdoors or be closed off for a more intimate setting. 
            Children have a unique way of learning and my goal was to give them the best opportunity to learn and have fun. 
            The combination of learning and playing go hand in hand. 
            The goal was to engage the children’s minds in a way that would provide them the best experience. 
            The flexibility of the school isn’t fully represented in the plans and the collage renders can do a better job providing necessary examples of active learning.
